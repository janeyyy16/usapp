-- =====================================================================
-- 0301 — let Admin/SuperAdmin/SuperSuperAdmin self-edit their own extra_roles
--
-- 0225's restrict_profile_self_edit_columns() already lets a trusted-tier
-- account (ADMIN/SUPERADMIN/SUPERSUPERADMIN) self-edit their own primary
-- `role` column, but the exact same exception was never extended to
-- `extra_roles` — that column was blocked for EVERY role, including
-- SuperAdmin, with no exception at all. That's an inconsistency, not a
-- deliberate choice: a SuperAdmin already bypasses every access gate in
-- the app regardless of what's in their own extra_roles (hasDashboardAccess
-- always returns true for SUPERADMIN before it even looks at extra_roles),
-- so there is no real self-lockout risk in letting one edit their own.
--
-- The restriction stays fully in place for everyone below that tier —
-- this does NOT reopen the real privilege-escalation case (e.g. a CSR
-- Agent self-granting "ADMIN" via their own extra_roles), since the
-- `my_role not in (...)` check below is unchanged from 0225's.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL Editor, after 0225.
