-- 0246 — Late ticket completions: Claims sign-off + payroll carry-forward
--
-- Tech payroll counts a ticket toward pay once its status reaches
-- CL-Claimed/CL-Completed (isCompletedStatus() in techPayroll.ts), computed
-- live from tickets.schedule_date every time a period is opened. If a
-- ticket's status only reaches one of those two AFTER the calendar week
-- (Sunday-Saturday) it was scheduled in has already ended, nobody is ever
-- told and there's no path to add it to pay later — it's silently missed
-- unless someone happens to re-open that exact past period.
--
-- This adds fully server-side detection (a trigger, so it doesn't depend on
-- anyone having the app open): the moment a ticket's status transitions into
-- CL-Claimed/CL-Completed and that transition happens after its own
-- scheduled week has ended, a pending row is inserted here. The app then:
--   - shows a blocking confirm/reject popup to CLAIMS-role users
--     (LateTicketCompletionModal.tsx, mounted in __root.tsx)
--   - on confirm, alerts Accounting (via the existing notifyRequestReviewers
--     pattern in employeeRequests.ts) and the ticket becomes eligible to be
--     folded into that technician's NEXT payroll run as a separate,
--     clearly-labeled carried-over line item (techPayroll.ts)
--   - on reject, the row is simply marked rejected — no alert, no payroll
--     impact, ever.
--
-- is_claims() mirrors is_finance()'s role-or-extra_roles pattern exactly
-- (0206_finance_can_edit_profiles.sql).
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL Editor, after 0245.

-- Sits alongside trg_ticket_audit (log_ticket_change(), 0001_init.sql) rather
-- than replacing it. Fires only on the one-time transition INTO
-- CL-Claimed/CL-Completed (re-saving the same completed status again, or
-- moving between the two, does not re-fire it — unique(ticket_id) also
-- guards this), and only when that transition happens strictly after the
-- Sunday-Saturday week containing the ticket's schedule_date has ended.
