-- 0031 — CSR Agent Notes: two-stage approval (department Manager, then HR)
--
-- The review workflow (0029) was single-stage: anyone in a reviewer role
-- (CSR Manager, Manager, Admin, Superadmin, HR) could unilaterally approve
-- or reject a submission. This adds a real chain of command matching how
-- it actually works, e.g. for CSR staff: Team Leader submits -> CSR
-- Manager reviews first -> HR makes the final call.
--
-- New flow:
--   pending          -> a department-level manager decides:
--                         - approve  -> manager_approved (goes to HR)
--                         - reject   -> rejected (terminal — the direct
--                           manager already found it invalid, HR doesn't
--                           need to re-review it)
--   manager_approved -> HR makes the final call:
--                         - approve  -> approved (now counts toward the
--                           employee's official tally, same rule as before)
--                         - reject   -> rejected
--
-- reviewed_by/reviewed_at now specifically mean "who made the terminal
-- decision" (whichever stage that happened at); manager_reviewed_by/at is
-- new and always records the department manager's stage-1 sign-off when
-- there was one.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL Editor, after 0030.
