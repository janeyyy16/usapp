-- 0339 — Reset "picked up" when a part's status goes back.
--
-- Part Daily Pickup's ✓ (parts.picked_up / picked_up_date) is separate from
-- the part's status. If the status is moved BACK to before pickup — Need PO,
-- PO Made or Part Ready (set by mistake, visit rescheduled, …) — the ✓ used
-- to stay, so the part kept showing on Part Daily Collection as "picked up"
-- even though the technician never had it.
--
-- This clears picked_up / picked_up_date whenever the status changes to one
-- of those earlier statuses, no matter where the change came from (ticket
-- page, Part Receive, a sync). It only reacts to the status change — it
-- doesn't touch distributor integrations or any other field.
--
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL Editor, after 0338.
