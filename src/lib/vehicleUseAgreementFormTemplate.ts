/**
 * Vehicle Use Agreement — a brand-new document type (distinct from the
 * existing "Company Vehicle Use Agreement" / vehicle_agreement, which
 * draws onto its own real source PDF via pdf-lib and uses different
 * wording). This one has no source PDF at all — same from-scratch
 * HTML-template-captured-to-PDF technique as the Warning Form/Contractor
 * Data (see captureHtmlToPdfBlob in pdfCapture.ts), built directly from
 * the 21-clause "Contractor" agreement text as given, verbatim.
 *
 * Single-party — one contractor fills in Name/Date/Branch and signs, no
 * employer/HR co-signature step, same shape as Car IQ/Contractor Data.
 * Branch reuses the same 27-branch list every other document in this
 * family already uses (re-exported from carIqAgreementFormTemplate.ts,
 * same idiom the existing vehicle_agreement type uses).
