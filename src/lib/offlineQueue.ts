/**
 * Offline action queue for the mobile technician app — On-Site Check-In
 * ("I'm Here"/"I'm Done"), Visit Log saves, ticket photo uploads, ticket
 * comments, and timecard punches. When a write fails (offline, or any
 * transient network error — the two look identical from here), the caller
 * enqueues it here instead of just alerting and giving up; drainQueue
 * replays every queued row once back online. See src/lib/isOnline.ts for
 * the app's shared "are we online right now" signal — this file doesn't
 * expose one of its own beyond the cheap navigator.onLine early-out in
 * drainQueue below.
 *
 * Also holds a small local cache of resolved ticket lat/lng (cacheTicketGeocode/
 * getCachedTicketGeocode) so the On-Site Check-In radius gate — pure
 * client-side math (haversineMiles in mapEngine.ts) — can keep working with
 * zero network once a technician's route has loaded for the day.
 *
 * And a generic fallback READ cache (cacheRead/getCachedRead — ticket list,
 * comments, on-site check-in status) so closing the app/tab while offline and
 * reopening it still has real data to render instead of a blank screen. This
 * one is a pure fallback: a real fetch is always tried first and always wins
 * when it succeeds; the cache is only read after that fetch has already
 * failed. See MobileTechApp.tsx's ticket-list/comments/check-in-status fetch
 * effects for the exact call sites.
 *
 * A separate Dexie database from src/lib/db.ts's AHSDatabase on purpose —
 * that one is unrelated legacy dummy/demo data for a handful of never-
 * fully-wired generic CRUD modules, not a real write path. Reuses the
 * `dexie` library already in package.json rather than adding a second one.
