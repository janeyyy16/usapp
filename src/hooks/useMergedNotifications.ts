/**
 * Shared notification-loading logic for NotificationsMenu.tsx (the header
 * bell dropdown) and NotificationCenterPage.tsx (the full "view all" page,
 * both desktop and mobile) — extracted so both surfaces stay in sync
 * without duplicating the merge/subscribe/mark-read logic.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes system-kind DMs — those are genuine messages (e.g.
 * Attendance Monitoring's "Notify Individual"/"Notify Team Lead" alerts),
 * and already have their own home in MessagesMenu/the internal messenger.
 * Showing them here too would duplicate the same item in two different
 * bells. This hook only merges the two true "notification" sources:
 *
 *  1. The dedicated `notifications` table (see migration 0035) — alerts
 *     that should never show up as a message (e.g. "new employee request
 *     submitted"). These can carry a `linkTo` so clicking one navigates
 *     straight to the relevant page.
 *  2. HR only: a realtime Firestore subscription (notifications/{uid}/items
 *     via subscribeNotifications) — the existing
 *     sendNotificationToRole()/users_index Firestore architecture, and how
 *     the Jotform webhook (api/jotform.ts) delivers "New Form Submitted"
 *     pings since a Cloudflare Worker can't run the Supabase-scoped,
 *     session-based write path the other source uses. Chimes on genuinely
 *     new arrivals (not on the first snapshot after subscribing).
